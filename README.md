## Overview

> Hi everyone! I'm a new Masters student in Statistics attending UBC. I also
> completed my undergraduate degree in Statistics at UBC as well, so I'm pretty
> familiar with the campus. I also have quite a lot of experience working with R
> after completing much of my co-op at the British Columbia Centre for Disease
> Control. I've also had some previous experience with Rmarkdown and Git/Github
> from STAT 450, the statistical consulting class for undergraduates.

## How Changes to README.md Were Made

> To edit README.md, I went with the second approach. This involved pulling,
> editting locally, saving, comitting and pushing back to github.com. I primarily
> have prior experience working with Git from STAT 450. Combined with the
> refresher I got from our previous STAT 545 classes, I didn't encounter too many
> problems. It felt pretty easy to go through the steps.
>
> I should note though that merge conflicts were a major problem in STAT 450 when
> working with collaborators. This resulted in difficulty pushing to the
> repository, even after pulling and resolving the conflicts (an error would still
> occur). Hopefully this won't be an issue in future assignments.
