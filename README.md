## Overview

Hi everyone! I'm a new Masters student in Statistics attending UBC. I also completed my undergraduate degree in Statistics at UBC as well, so I'm pretty familiar with the campus. I also have quite a lot of experience working with R after completing much of my co-op at the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control. I've also had some previous experience with Rmarkdown and Git/Github from STAT 450, the statistical consulting class for undergraduates.

## How Changes to README.md were Made

To edit README.md, I went with the second approach. This involved pulling, editting locally, saving, comitting and pushing back to my repository. I primarily have prior experience working with Git from STAT 450. Combined with the refresher I got from our previous STAT 545 classes, I didn't encounter too many problems. It felt pretty easy to go through the steps. Also, the Markdown tutorial from [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) was a useful resource.

I should note though that merge conflicts were a major problem in STAT 450 when working with collaborators. This resulted in difficulty pushing to the repository, even after pulling and resolving the conflicts (an error would still occur). Hopefully this won't be an issue in future assignments.


## How the R Markdown Document was Created

Just like README.md, the R Markdown document was created using the second approach. I created a new R Markdown file, made changes to it, saved it, committed and then pulled+pushed to my repository. The only issues I encountered were having to look up how to suppress the different outputs. These include the actual lines of code (echo=F), output messages (message=F) and warnings (warning=F). I used these previously but I had forgotten them.

As I've said before, I have some experience with R Markdown from STAT 450.
